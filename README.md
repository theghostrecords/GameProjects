# GameProjects
Two games created in a group project for the course INF112 at UiB.

The primary game worked on was BergenTD, therefore Spooks contains a lot of bugs. 

To play the games simply clone or download the repo -> extract .jar from  the zip files -> run the game 

code and documentation is written by a large group of people and is therefore of varied quality.
