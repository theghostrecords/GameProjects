Code is located in core/src/*

Assets are located in core/assets/*

Almost all of the assets were made by individuals in the group, and the rest is open game art.

This game was made from scratch using the libgdx library for java in about 15 days by a group of 10-15 CS bachelor students. This is the first time anyone in the group used libgdx and the code has not been touched since the assignement was delivered, so the code itself is not top notch.
